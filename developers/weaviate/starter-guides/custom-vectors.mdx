Weaviate is a vector database. [Vector databases](/blog/vector-library-vs-vector-database) store data objects and vectors that represent those objects. When you import a data object, you normally include a vector representation of that object as well. The vector representation is also called an "embedding."

This guide discusses importing data that already has vectors. An alternative approach is to use a [vectorizer](../modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/index.md) model to generate vectors at import time. Weaviate has [integrations](/developers/weaviate/model-providers) that support most popular models.

To import data with your own vectors, follow these steps:

1. Create a Weaviate instance
2. Connect to the Weaviate instance
3. Import data that specifies its own vectors
4. Perform a vector search with Weaviate

## Setup

This section introduces the example data and setup requirements.

### Example Data

The example dataset is 10 questions from the popular quiz show "Jeopardy!". Each of the questions has an associated vector embedding.

In this example, these vectors were obtained through an OpenAI API, using the <nobr>[`text-embedding-ada-002` model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)</nobr>. But your vectors can come from any source, such as another inference service provider (e.g Cohere or Hugging Face) or your own fine-tuned model.

### Weaviate Instance

Weaviate is open source. You can [run Weaviate](/developers/weaviate/installation) locally, in the cloud, or as a service. If you want to follow this guide without setting up an instance of your own, consider using a free, Sandbox instance in [Weaviate Cloud]/developers/wcs/quickstart).

### Client library

[Client libraries](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries) simplify working with Weaviate. Clients are available for multiple programming languages. This guide provides examples in Python, Typescript, and cURL.

To install a client library, use the installer for the client language:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python Client v4">
The v4 client requires Weaviate 1.23 or higher.<br/><br/>

```bash
pip install -U weaviate-client
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py3" label="Python Client v3">

```bash
pip install "weaviate-client==3.*"
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="JS/TS Client v3">

```bash
npm install weaviate-client --tag next
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js2" label="JS/TS Client v2">

```bash
npm install weaviate-ts-client
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Connect to Weaviate

To connect to your Weaviate instance, you need the following information:

- The Weaviate URL
- The Weaviate API key

If you are using a Sandbox instance, the URL and API keys are listed in the [details panel](/developers/wcs/quickstart#explore-the-details-panel) for your instance.

To connect to Weaviate, run the code for your language to create a client object. Re-use the `client` object in the later steps.

import ConnectToWeaviate from '/_includes/code/quickstart/connect.noheader.mdx'

<ConnectToWeaviate />

## Collection definition

Weaviate stores [data](../concepts/data.md) in collections. Each data object in a collection has a set of properties and a vector representation. Before you import data, you should create a [collection definition](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/schema) to define the collection properties.

The data property definitions are called a schema. Vectorizers are also defined at the collection level. Details, such as the specific model, or vectorization behavior, are defined at the property level.

This is a guide to using your own vectors. It assumes you already have vector embeddings for your data. The sample configuration code sets the vectorizer to `none` because the vector embeddings are included with the import file.

For more on configurations, see [specify]vectorizer settings](/developers/weaviate/manage-data/collections#specify-vectorizer-settings).

### Define the collection

import CreateSchema from '/_includes/code/quickstart.byov.schema.mdx'

<CreateSchema />

### Optional: Set a compatible vectorizer
If Weaviate has an [integration](/developers/weaviate/model-providers) for the vectorizer that you use to generate you custom vectors, consider adding your vectorizer to the collection definition.  If you specify a vectorizer, Weaviate can generate new vectors when it needs them.<br/>

In this example, the vectors are generated by an OpenAI model, `ada-002`. Weaviate provides an OpenAI integration, `text2vec-openai`, that can access the `ada-002` model so you would specify `text2vec-openai` in the collection definition.

Weaviate uses the vectors you provide at import even if the collection specifies a vectorizer.

## Import data and vectors

The example data is based on a set of ten questions from the "Jeopardy!" television program. [The data file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaviate-tutorials/quickstart/main/data/jeopardy_tiny_with_vectors_all-OpenAI-ada-002.json) is a JSON formatted document that contains the vectors and the underlying data.

For large datasets, batch import is more efficient than importing individual objects. This [batch import](/developers/weaviate/tutorials/import#batch-import-process) code imports the question objects, including their vectors.

import ImportQuestionsWithVectors from '/_includes/code/quickstart.import.questions+vectors.mdx'

<ImportQuestionsWithVectors />

:::tip Vectors are not object properties
When you specify the elements of your batch import, be careful not to mislabel vectors as properties. If the vector is listed in the properties section, Weaviate processes it as a regular property, rather than as a vector embedding.
:::

## Query

In order to query a vector, Weaviate needs a vector representation of the query. If the collection definition specifies a vectorizer, Weaviate uses that vectorizer to generate a vector embedding for the query. The example collection in this guide does not specify a vectorizer. Since Weaviate cannot vectorize the query, you have to supply a query vector.

For example, to search the database for questions related to biology, use the same vectorizer that you used to create the data embedding to vectorize "biology" (the query term). Since the sample vectors are created with the `ada-002` model, the query ("biology") is also vectorized using the `ada-002` model.

This [`nearVector`](/developers/weaviate/search/similarity#search-with-a-vector) query use the vector embedding of "biology" to search the database:

import NearVector from '/_includes/code/quickstart.query.nearVector.mdx';

<NearVector />

You should see something like this:

import BiologyQuestionsJson from '/_includes/code/quickstart/response.biology.questions.mdx';

<BiologyQuestionsJson />

## Recap

If you made it here - well done. We have covered a lot, and you've successfully built a fully functioning vector database! ðŸ¥³

You have:
- Populated your Weaviate instance with your own vectors, and
- Performed text similarity searches.

Of course, there is a lot more to Weaviate that we have not yet covered, and probably a lot that you wish to know about. So we include a few links below that might help you to get started in your journey with us.
